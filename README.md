# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Fernando Vieira

Hello, my name is Fernando. I am a student of Mathematics and Data Science, and I currently work at one of the largest education companies in Brazil, where I create analyses, models, automations, and dashboards.

Today, I specialize in Python and R. Besides using them for Data Science and AI, I develop web apps with Django, Flask, and FastAPI, and I explore areas of data engineering.
